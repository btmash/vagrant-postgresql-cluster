From DB-1 (and for all DB servers)

apt-get install postgresql
sudo su - postgres
psql
# Postgres CLI Commands
CREATE ROLE 'username' WITH PASSWORD 'password' CREATEDB LOGIN REPLICATION SUPERUSER
CREATE DATABASE username
\q
# END Postgres CLI commands

vim /etc/postgresql/VERSION_NUMBER/main/postgresql.conf
  - Update listen_address='*' (or whatever your IPs (comma separated) to listen from might be - this can be restricted further)
vim /etc/postgresql/VERSION_NUMBER/main/pg_hba.conf
    - host all username IP_ADDRESS md5

service postgresql restart

## IMPORTANT TUNING VARIABLES

listen_address
  - which ip address can connect to server. Important for security
max_connections
  - max # of sessions that can connect to server. important to not run out of memory.
shared_buffers
  - amount of RAM dedicated to hold requests waiting in kernel buffer/cpu
  - should be 15 - 25% of total memory you dedicate for DB server.
effective_cache_size
  - amount of RAM dedicated to tables indexes.
  - typically 50 - 75% of system memory
work_mem
  - amount of memory used for sorting
  - be very careful on this as it is per-operation. Can chew up memory.


## REPLICATION

Followed http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2013/02/16/zero-to-postgresql-streaming-replication-in-10-mins/

## INSTALL PGPOOL-2 (separate pool server ideally)

vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgpd.list
  - deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ trusty-pgdg main
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
apt-get update
apt-get install pgpool2

vim /etc/pgpool2/pcp.conf
  - pgpool:e8a48653851e28c69d0506508fb27fc5

create

vim /etc/pgpool2/pgpool.conf
  - SET UP IN SAME WAY as postgresql server

create pool_passwd file
  - set up users with passwords in file
  - drupal:md5478637af468c617dd9e6fffd8a7f6322

## DISADVANTAGES
  - So much setup!
  - Potential overhead due to pool (versus figuring out logic in application)

## ADVANTAGES
  - Can have X replica servers
  - Can have health checks on servers (so promote replica server to master if current master starts failing)
  - Connection pool can be limiter to stop db server from getting too many connections and trashing server on that end.
